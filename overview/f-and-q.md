### Will a new wallet created in Konnect have security risks?

Please keep the wallet mnemonics and private key in a safe and reliable place. Once they are lost or leaked, the assets in your wallet will be lost.

### Will users be punished by Konnect for bad behaviors such as false information and malicious links posted in Konnect?

Konnect is a decentralized social platform and Konnect will not take any action against those users.&#x20;

But all users in Konnect have specific KID identities.&#x20;

When user A commits bad behaviours above, other users will mark his DID identities, such as "spammers" or "malicious link publishers", etc., resulting in damage to the reputation of user A, and no user is willing to engage in social activities with user A, which may be one of the best ways to punish misbehaving users.

### What is KID? What is the use of KID identities within Konnect?

KID can be understood as a decentralized identity.&#x20;

Since the behaviour and activities of the Web3.0 wallet on the chain are open, transparent and unchangeable, the wallet-to-wallet activities can represent an integral part of the user's true identity.&#x20;

Specifically in Konnect, it is the user's interaction through this wallet to hold a certain asset or perform certain activities on the chain, which can show the real certificate of the user's interest, contribution, assets, and activity time. This kind of certificate information can constitute a KID identity.&#x20;

The KID identity in Konnect is the user's social credential. It acts the same as the credit score of Web2.0, but the KID identity of Konnect is decentralized and soul-bounded. Using Konnect's KID identity can improve the authenticity of social activities.

### Can I stay in the corresponding DAO group after I sell the specific Tokens/NFTs?

No, Once your wallet loses all its Tokens/NFT, you will be out of this DAO group by default.&#x20;

Of course, you can reacquire Tokens/NFTs by purchasing them, etc., and join the DAO group again.
